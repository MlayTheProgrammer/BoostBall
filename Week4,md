# Previous Goals
1. Implement ball physics
2. Start platform interactions
3. Start main menu layout
4. Create fully animated coin/power up sprites.
5. Create three different platform sprites.
6. Work on ball variants.

# Progress and Issues
1. Worked on two different platform sprites and nearly finished them. Got stuck with resizing an old canvas and asked Mikey for help. Learned that canvas resolution is
important. [Tim]
2. Created sprites and animations for the Coin and Shield objects. Interacted with the Unity particle system to create effects for these objects,
and ran into issues creating uniquely shaped particles using this particle system. [Michael]

3. Worked on the ball and platform physics. Made the ball reset if it falls off platform. 
Also added the camera to the ball so the user knows exactly where the ball is at all times. [Reggie]

4. About 85% done with main menu. Struggled with naming conventions. 
Lead to using the wrong methods for certain events. Got it sorted out. [C. Brewster]

5. Implemented the generation for the platform as well as the the force application to push the ball to the next potential platform [C. Breedlove].

# Goals for Next Week
1. Tim will work on another ball variant or two as well as finish the hologram platform animation.
2. Mikey will finish player animation for power up objects.
3. Cade Brewster will finish the main menu UI by next meeting.
4. Cade Breedlove will implement platform variants.
5. Reggie will finish touch controls/ mouse input for the ball.
